## How to write code review comments

> https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/reviewer/comments.html

Nit: This is a minor thing. Technically you should do it, but it won’t hugely impact things.
e.g) nit: can use Optional instead of null

Optional (or Consider): I think this may be a good idea, but it’s not strictly required.

FYI: I don’t expect you to do this in this CL, but you may find this interesting to think about for the future.
